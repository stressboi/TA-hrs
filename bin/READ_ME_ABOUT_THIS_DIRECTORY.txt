You will need to place the nmap distribution into the "nmap" directory.

You can get it from: https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.91-win32.zip

You MAY need to ensure the 2013 Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is installed.

That's in the nmap distro, and is called "vcredist_x86.exe"

IF you want to run the OS fingerprinting version of the scan, you need to install npcap, too.

That's also in the nmap distro, and is called "npcap-1.00.exe"
